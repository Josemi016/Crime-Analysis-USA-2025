## Project Overview

This repository contains the results of a comprehensive data analysis project focused on crime incidents reported throughout the United States during the year 2025. The primary objective of this work is to examine both temporal and spatial trends in criminal activity, using publicly available geospatial datasets and robust statistical techniques.

By combining data visualization, predictive modeling, and geospatial clustering, the study offers a multi-dimensional view of crime patterns. The insights gained from this analysis may support further research, policymaking, and public safety strategy design.
